# Flutter-rhyme-app

## Information 
Very minimal basic app to understand API and Flutter programming.



## Working
You write the word in the input field, and the app send requests to the Rhymezone API, which returns the near rhymes.
At, the end it prints the rhymes in the tabular form.

## Things I learned:-
-  How do widgets work.
- How a JSON must be parsed according to language specific objects/types/Data structures.
- What exactly is a framework.
- How Flutter remains platform independent, and what are the drawbacks due to that.
- How difficult is it to develop GUI apps(my admiration to all those people who spend hours doing this)
- How does OOP works:- I still have a lot to venture into, I dislike it a lot, but I also like it. It was a refreshing break from my usual routine of Rust and C. I liked it.
